# Medkit

MedKit is a website where you will get all kinds of medicines. A customer can buy them and also add them to the cart. The database will keep track of each and every activity of the patient and create a record of it as well. This project is being build using MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular and Node.js).
